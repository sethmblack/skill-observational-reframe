# Observational Reframe

Transform political, social, or cultural observations into Trevor Noah-style comedy by applying the outsider's lens to reveal inherent absurdities and contradictions.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Mock vulnerable people or punch down at marginalized communities
- Create false equivalencies that trivialize real suffering
- Trivialize trauma, violence, or oppression for cheap laughs
- Use this technique to spread misinformation or distort facts
- Apply the reframe to content that reinforces harmful stereotypes

**If asked to reframe harmful content:** Refuse explicitly. Explain that the observational reframe reveals truth through comedy, not distortion.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Political or social commentary feels preachy or heavy-handed
- An observation needs the outsider's perspective to land
- Complex issues need to be made accessible without dumbing down
- You want to help people see the absurdity already present in a situation
- Content needs Trevor Noah's signature "here's what's wild about this" energy
- Someone requests "make this funny but truthful" or "give me the outsider take"

**Do NOT use when:**
- The topic requires purely factual analysis without commentary
- The situation is too fresh/traumatic for comedic processing
- You lack sufficient understanding of the context to find the real contradiction
- The client wants cheerleading, not critique

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `observation` | Yes | The serious observation, political topic, or social phenomenon to reframe | "Police violence disproportionately affects Black Americans" |
| `audience_context` | No | Who this is for and what they already know | "American audience, mixed political views, Daily Show demographic" |
| `comparison_source` | No | Specific outsider perspective to apply | "South African apartheid experience" or "immigrant perspective" |
| `tone_target` | No | Desired balance of humor vs. insight | "70% insight, 30% comedy" or "equal parts funny and challenging" |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Unquestioned Assumption

Find what people take for granted or what "everyone knows" about this topic.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the official narrative?
- What do insiders assume is natural/normal/inevitable?
- What's the polite fiction everyone maintains?
- What would be "rude" or "naive" to question?

**Example:**
- **Observation:** "Police violence disproportionately affects Black Americans"
- **Assumption:** "Police are here to protect and serve everyone equally"

### Step 2: Apply the Outsider Lens

Bring a perspective from someone who doesn't share that assumption—ideally someone who has seen a similar system work differently or more honestly.

**Lenses to consider:**
- **International comparison:** "In South Africa, we knew police were the enforcement arm of apartheid"
- **Immigrant perspective:** "Coming to America, this thing you call 'normal' looks completely bizarre"
- **Historical context:** "This has happened before, just under a different name"
- **Class perspective:** "Rich people don't experience this system the same way"
- **Literal outsider:** "If aliens landed and observed this, they'd think..."

**Example:**
- **Lens:** South African apartheid experience
- **Application:** "In South Africa, police weren't pretending to 'serve and protect'—they were openly there to maintain the racial order. No one was confused about the job."

### Step 3: Reveal the Contradiction

Show what the outsider can see that the insider can't or won't acknowledge. Point out the gap between the stated purpose and the actual function.

**Techniques:**
- **Pattern naming:** "This keeps happening in exactly the same way, but we keep calling it a 'bad apple'"
- **Function vs. claim:** "You say it's for X, but it consistently produces Y"
- **Who benefits?:** "This problem hurts some people while protecting others—that's not a bug"
- **Repeated surprise:** "You keep acting shocked when the thing does the thing it was designed to do"

**Example:**
- "Americans act surprised every time a video comes out. 'Oh my God, can you believe the police did this thing?' And I'm like, yes? I can believe it? Because that's what they were designed to do."

### Step 4: Crystallize with Metaphor

Land the insight with a concrete comparison that makes the absurdity visceral and memorable.

**Metaphor types:**
- **Tool analogy:** "Expecting a hammer to turn screws"
- **Performance comparison:** "Like being shocked the actor keeps playing the villain"
- **Animal behavior:** "Snake gonna snake"
- **System design:** "The machine is working exactly as built; we're just pretending it's broken"

**Example:**
- "It's like everyone keeps expecting the hammer to start acting like a screwdriver, and then we're shocked when it keeps hammering. 'Why isn't this hammer turning screws?' Because it's a hammer. It's doing exactly what hammers do."

### Step 5: Land the Insight (Trust the Audience)

Don't explain the moral or connect all the dots. The audience got it. Land with the observation and let it sit.

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ "So we need to completely reform the police"
- ❌ "This proves systemic racism is real"
- ❌ "The lesson here is..."

**What TO do:**
- ✓ "That's not a bug. That's the feature."
- ✓ End with the metaphor and move on
- ✓ "And before you get mad at me, I'm not saying X. I'm saying Y."
- ✓ Acknowledge complexity: "I'm not saying individual police officers are bad people. I'm saying the tool itself was built for a specific purpose."

2. **Outsider Lens Applied** - The fresh perspective that reveals what insiders can't see
3. **Contradiction Revealed** - The gap between claim and function
4. **Crystallizing Metaphor** - The concrete comparison that makes it stick
5. **Complete Reframed Observation** - Full Trevor Noah-style commentary ready to use

**Format:**
```
**Original observation:** [input]

**Unquestioned assumption:** [what people take for granted]

**Outsider lens:** [fresh perspective applied]

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Observation is too vague | Ask for specific phenomenon or event to ground the reframe |
| Topic requires expertise user lacks | Acknowledge limitation, offer reframe based on available info, note what's missing |
| Reframe risks punching down | Refuse and explain: "This would mock vulnerable people, not reveal system absurdity" |
| Multiple contradictions exist | Choose the sharpest one and note others could be explored separately |
| Metaphor isn't landing | Generate 2-3 alternatives and let user choose or refine |
| Can't find genuine outsider angle | Acknowledge: "I'm not finding the authentic outsider perspective here. What I can offer is..." |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
observation: "Americans debate gun control after every mass shooting but nothing ever changes"
audience_context: "Daily Show audience, politically aware, frustrated by inaction"
```

**Output:**

**Unquestioned assumption:** "The debate is genuinely about finding solutions to prevent shootings"

**Outsider lens:** Immigrant perspective—someone who moved from a country with strict gun laws and far fewer mass shootings

**Revealed contradiction:** The debate isn't stuck because solutions are unknown; other countries have proven solutions. The debate is stuck because it's not actually about solving the problem—it's about maintaining the current system.

**Crystallizing metaphor:** "It's like watching someone stuck in a rainstorm, getting completely soaked, and refusing to use an umbrella because umbrellas are 'controversial'"

**Reframed in Trevor Noah voice:**

"You know what's wild about growing up in South Africa and then watching American gun debates? In South Africa, we had a lot of problems—crime, violence, all kinds of things. But you know what we didn't have? Mass shootings every other week.

Because after apartheid ended, the country said 'Hey, maybe we shouldn't have so many guns everywhere after we just had a violent oppressive regime.' And they actually did something about it. And it worked. Not perfectly—nothing works perfectly—but it worked.

So I move to America, and after every mass shooting, there's this big debate. 'What can we possibly do? If only there was some way to prevent this!' And I'm sitting there like, 'Well, Australia did something. Japan did something. The UK did something. Most of Europe did something. It's not a mystery.'

But then I realized: the debate isn't actually 'How do we solve this?' The debate is 'How do we keep pretending this is unsolvable?' Because if you admitted it was solvable, you'd have to admit you're choosing not to solve it.

It's like watching someone standing in the rain, getting completely soaked, holding an umbrella, but refusing to open it because 'umbrellas are controversial.' And you're like, 'You're getting wet!' And they're like, 'Yes, it's terrible! What can be done?' And you point at the umbrella in their hand, and they're like, 'Let's not get political.'

That's not a debate. That's a performance."
